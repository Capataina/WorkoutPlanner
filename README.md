The Interactive Workout Planner is a modern web application for planning weekly workouts in a mesocycle (multi-week training cycle). It helps ensure each muscle group hits a target volume (10â€“20 sets/week) and supports automatic progression (e.g., adding 1 set each subsequent week). You can:

- Drag and drop exercises into daily slots.
- View real-time muscle group set counts (including partial credit for secondary muscles).
- Plan progressive overload over a user-defined number of weeks.
- Create or customize exercises, swap exercises, and manage templates.

The UI is purposefully minimalistic, featuring a dark-themed design inspired by popular modern interfaces. Everything is built with React + TypeScript and leverages shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS for consistent styling.


Tech Stack:
- React + TypeScript
- shadcn/ui (for components)
- Tailwind CSS (for styling)
- Vite (for bundling)
- Vercel (for deployment)
- Drag and Drop (dnd-kit)
- Zustand (for state management)
